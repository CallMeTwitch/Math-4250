## Project 1: K-Armed Bandit Problem
Abstract: This paper presents a novel probabilistic strategy for addressing the k-armed bandit problem, leveraging probability computations derived from observed rewards. Our method is benchmarked against standard algorithms such as greedy, epsilon-greedy, optimistic initialization, and gradient bandit strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a ~5\% improvement in average accumulated reward (AAR) and ~10\% improvement in percent optimal action (POA) over most standard algorithms in stationary environments, and an increase over all standard algorithms in some non-stationary environments, making it a competitive alternative to existing methods.
