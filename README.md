## Project 1: K-Armed Bandit Problem
Abstract: This paper presents a novel probabilistic strategy for addressing the k-armed bandit problem, leveraging probability computations derived from observed rewards. Our method is benchmarked against standard algorithms such as greedy, epsilon-greedy, optimistic initialization, and gradient bandit strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a ~5\% improvement in average accumulated reward (AAR) and ~10\% improvement in percent optimal action (POA) over most standard algorithms in stationary environments, and an increase over all standard algorithms in some non-stationary environments, making it a competitive alternative to existing methods.

## Project 2: GridWorld
Abstract: this paper implements and analyzes a range of methods for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in a 5 Ã— 5 GridWorld environment including explicit solutions, iterative methods, and Monte Carlo approaches. By applying these techniques to both stationary and dynamic variants of the environment, we gain insight into their relative strengths, limitations, and practical applications. This report presents our findings, comparing the performance and characteristics of different RL algorithms in solving the GridWorld problem. Through this analysis, we aim to deepen our understanding of core RL concepts, and contextualize their place in modern AI.
